# xboxdrv-daemon
xboxdrv is adversiting gamepads are connected whether gamepad connected or not
this daemon starts or stops the daemon when gamepad plugged or unplugged
aaaand it pushes notifications when it plugged or unplugged AND it vanishes 1 second later(WOW! SUCH FEATURE)

for now you have to edit ids in the code
i might or might not add automatic detection 
this is not intented for multiple gamepads but probably will work fine

install by simply executing install.sh with sudo

feel free to contribute if you somehow managed to found this repository
